"""
This Python script provides functionalities for parsing chat transcripts that contain file paths and code blocks,
applying diffs to these files, and parsing unified git diff format strings. The script is designed to work within
a larger system that involves processing and manipulating code files based on chat inputs and diff information.

Key Components:
- chat_to_files_dict: Parses a chat transcript, extracting file paths and associated code blocks, and organizes
  them into a FilesDict object, which is a custom dictionary format designed to hold file contents keyed by their paths.

- apply_diffs: Takes a dictionary of Diff objects (which represent changes to be made to files) and a FilesDict
  object containing the current state of files. It applies the changes described by the Diff objects to the
  corresponding files in the FilesDict, updating the file contents as specified by the diffs.

- parse_diffs: Parses a string containing diffs in the unified git diff format, extracting the changes described
  in the diffs and organizing them into a dictionary of Diff objects, keyed by the filename to which each diff applies.

- parse_diff_block: Parses a single block of text from a diff string, translating it into a Diff object that
  represents the changes described in that block of text.

This script is intended for use in environments where code collaboration or review is conducted through chat interfaces,
allowing for the dynamic application of changes to code bases and the efficient handling of file and diff information in chat transcripts.
